//! Internal JSPI (JS Promise Integration) machinery.
//!
//! The public surface is a single function, `futures::jspi_block_on_promise`:
//! suspend the current promising execution until a JS `Promise` settles. The
//! executor side has no API at all — `spawn_local` (and everything built on
//! it, like `future_to_promise` and async exports) checks the ambient JSPI
//! context at spawn time and enters the task's polls through a
//! `WebAssembly.promising` boundary when spawned from within one, so sync
//! code reached from such a task may itself suspend. The capability is
//! inherited transitively: a task spawned from a promising-entered poll is
//! itself promising-entered.
//!
//! The runtime state is minimal by construction. The suspend bridge,
//! `__wbindgen_jspi_suspend`, is a plain `#[wasm_bindgen(catch, suspending)]`
//! import whose JS body is an identity function: JSPI itself awaits the
//! returned `Promise` and resumes with the settled value, while a rejection
//! is thrown into wasm as a `WebAssembly.JSTag` exception and marshalled to
//! `Err` by the standard `catch + suspending` machinery (see
//! `cli-support/src/transforms/jspi.rs`). The ambient context probe,
//! `__wbindgen_jspi_in_context`, is rewritten in-wasm by the CLI: it reads
//! the `__jspi_stack_base` global when JSPI instrumentation is active and is
//! a constant `0` otherwise, so modules that never use JSPI attributes carry
//! no JSPI machinery and keep running on engines without exnref/JSPI.

// The `suspending` attribute on the internal bridge import generates an
// experimental-status deprecation warning; this module is itself part of the
// experimental JSPI surface, so silence it here.
